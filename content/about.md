## Oh, hi!

I write things; mostly words, and sometimes in programming languages.

I'm passionate about programming, new tech, web culture, and helping people. I spend a lot of my free pouring over what's new in the industry, and the community surrounding it. If I'm not doing that you'll find me gaming, reading fantasy novels, drinking craft beer, or hanging out with my wife and dog.

This site will serve as a mix of musings on programming for sure, but also a collection of things I think are cool and choose to noodle on.
