...__tap tap__... is this thing on?

It's hard to start writing when you're staring at a blank page. My mind begins by trying to categorize all the types of posts I've thought about writing, but quickly blanks out. Having just watched myself write that, I think the next logical step is to not press backspace, and just keep going. So let's do that.

Hmm what to write... what to write... well I guess I can start by enumerating a list of things I've been thinking about writing, right?

* Imposter syndrome and how we keep on keeping on despite it.
* Figuring out that not wanting to become a manager has, in fact, started to make you the ideal candidate for becoming a manager.
* How to focus on being nice instead of being right while also being right.
* Explaining to a prospective employer that you're really good at knowing the medium-depth  __*jist*__ of a lot of things, but wouldn't categorize any of your specific knowledge as "deep".
* The importance of writing things down in order to decide not to do them.
* How to be a general enthusiast while staying positive for the future of your enthusiasms.
* How mid 2017 to mid 2018 was a year of love letters written to me by new games:
  * Horizon Zero Dawn
  * Mass Effect: Andromeda
  * God of War
  * Detroit Become Human
* Breakdowns of cool new things that I don't want to type more than once to [limit my keystrokes](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx):
  * Details on upcoming games, movies, music.
  * New tech (categories unimportant, tech is awesome and comes in all shapes and sizes)
  * Useful programming tidbits
  * Useless programming tidbits
  * Miscellaneous enthusiasms

That'll do, let's allow this list to set the tone for what will come here.

Signing off for now...
